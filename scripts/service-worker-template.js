// Service worker of the app: keeps one complete release, so the app starts without a network.
//
// This file is the worker's source. The build step (write-service-worker.ts, run after
// the bundler) writes the release into the placeholder below and saves the result as dist/sw.js; nothing
// else is changed. Each release therefore gets a worker that differs byte for byte, which is how the browser
// learns that there is a new one.
//
// How a release replaces another:
// - install fetches every file of the release, checks each against its SHA-256 and only then stores them, in
//   a cache of its own. One file that is missing, different or redirected fails the whole install and leaves
//   no part of the release behind (a deployment in progress can serve the old worker with new files); the
//   worker that was active before keeps serving its own release.
// - the new worker then waits. It never takes over a page that an older worker serves (no skipWaiting, no
//   clients.claim), so a page always gets its document and its scripts from one release. The browser
//   activates the new worker once every window of the app is closed, or sooner when the user asks for it
//   (an "install now" button): the page then sends the one message that makes this worker take over (skipWaiting)
//   and reloads itself once it has. Other open windows go on with the code they started with.
// - the release before stays stored until a page of this release starts. The browser may answer one more
//   launch with the page of the outgoing release and switch workers under it; that page then asks this
//   worker for its script and fonts, which the server no longer has, and gets them from the release they
//   belong to.
// - the start page of this release, answered from its own cache, removes the caches of other releases,
//   unless a newer release is being stored or waits for its turn. Only caches with this app's prefix are
//   touched; the app's own data (localStorage, IndexedDB) the worker never reads or writes.
//
// The release lists its files relative to this worker, which sits next to index.html: the same build works
// at the site root and under a sub-path. Stored copies are keyed by their absolute path.
